The goal of my diploma project was to create a modern and functional marketplace designed for 
seamless interaction between buyers and sellers. The project utilized cutting-edge technologies, 
including JavaScript, the ExpressJS server framework, the MongoDB database, and the Material UI library for creating user interfaces.

Main functionality of the project:
 1. For buyers:
 • The ability to conveniently search for and purchase products with detailed descriptions of each offer.
 • Management of a personal account, including profile updates, viewing order history, and tracking deliveries in real time.
 • Automatic interface translation into multiple languages, making the platform accessible to users from different countries.
 2. For sellers:
 • Tools for adding new products, editing their descriptions, managing orders, and processing incoming requests.
 • A built-in mini-accounting system that provides detailed statistics on store performance over a selected period. It includes data on sales, revenue, profits, and performance trends, helping sellers analyze their results and make strategic decisions.
 3. Unique features of the platform:
 • Integration of a trained ChatGPT model via API: This model functions as a customer support service, answering client questions and resolving their issues quickly, significantly enhancing user experience and loyalty.
 • Automatic interface translation: This feature adapts the platform for users speaking different languages, which is especially valuable for the international market.

Conclusion:

This diploma project successfully implemented a modern marketplace with an intuitive interface and rich functionality. Working on the project provided
an opportunity to study and apply advanced web application development technologies, deepen knowledge in databases, API integration, and intelligent systems.
The project also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence in e-commerce and business process automation.
